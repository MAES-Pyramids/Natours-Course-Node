The Natours app is a tour booking website built on top of NodeJS. It has various features such as authentication and authorization, tour booking, payment processing, user and admin profiles, and API usage. Users can search for tours, book them, manage their bookings, and update their profiles. The app also provides API endpoints for accessing information about tours, tour stats, top 5 cheap tours, and tours within a radius.

The app is built using several technologies such as Express, Mongoose, MongoDB Atlas, Pug, JSON Web Token, ParcelJS, Stripe, Postman, Mailtrap & Sendgrid, and Heroku. It also utilizes ESLint and Prettier for code formatting and style.

The project's goal is to provide a platform for users to easily search and book tours while also providing an easy-to-use and secure payment processing system. The project is intended to be scalable and maintainable, with room for further improvements and feature enhancements in the future.

The app's success can be measured by its ability to provide a seamless user experience and its ability to handle a large number of users and transactions. It is also successful if it meets the client's expectations and goals, which in this case is to provide a reliable and efficient tour booking website.
